# Subarashii-CPU

A homebrew 16-bit RISC CPU in Verilog.

This is the basis implementation and could change in the future.


## Specifications
* 16-bit RISC
* Harvard architecture
* single cycle execution
* 16 x 16-bit registers
* 16-bit instructions
* 64KB RAM
* Memory mapped I/O


## Future Goals
* Assembler; probably in C, Python, or Rust
* Video card and interface
* Serial interface
